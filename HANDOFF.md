# Handoff: the single-year player rankings, one experiment at a time

**This file is transient.**  It starts the next session and is deleted when Phase 1 ships.  `DECISIONS.md`
is the permanent record and carries every number quoted here.  Do not let this grow into a lab notebook.

Branch `cleanup`; `main` is fast-forwarded to it at each publish, and the live site is served from `docs/`
on `main`.  `pytest -q`: **336 passed, 1 failed, 1 xfailed, ~165 s** with the scraped data.  The failure is
accepted and named at the bottom of this file; nothing else is red.

## How we work (the owner, 2026-09-13/14)

- **Two jobs only: implement the owner's ideas, or propose new ones.**  Never run an idea the owner has
  not said "go" to.  One experiment at a time; never a queue of several overnight.
- **One test decides**: the year-over-year test below.  The consensus checks, the trade loss and the 2026
  top 20 (the eye test) are read every time and can veto; they are never fitted to.
- **Every experiment ends with the 2026 top 20** (`/experiment-comparison`; `scripts/66_compare.py`).
- **Plain words.**  No invented labels, no single-letter names, no "board" (say the player rankings), no
  "floor" (say the check).  Define a term the first time it is used.  End every message with a
  one-sentence TL;DR unless the message is itself one sentence.  **Movement is reported in points per 100,
  never in rank places**, and under 0.1 is nothing.
- **On the site and in anything published the ratings are "OpenRAPM"** -- never "ours" or "we" -- and the
  published pages are American English.  The repo's own prose is British; leave it.

## The rulings that bind

1. **One rating per player per season, from that season's games only**, regular season and playoffs.
2. **Single year or bust**: a player's own other seasons may not reach his rating, not even through the
   booster's memory (hence the out-of-player priors).  Model coefficients may be learned from other seasons.
3. **Never train on the current season until its Finals are over.**  Loading is always allowed.
4. **The SPM is trained on one row per player** (his career average with the rated season out) PLUS chunk
   rows of his seasons; not one row per player-season.
5. **Keep chimeraboost.  The consensus is a sanity check, never a fitting target**; a gross miss vetoes.
6. Each season is centred at possession-weighted zero per side (the RAPM convention), 2026-09-14.

## What ships (the incumbent, `scripts/62_single_year_board.py` defaults)

1. **Target**: `looseason.LeaveSeasonOutRAPM`, one RAPM per player over every season except the rated one
   (penalties 40,000 / 40,000 / 0, closed).
2. **SPM**: chimeraboost on `singleyear.chunk_rows` (the career row plus contiguous 1-, 2-, 3-season
   chunks, two features saying how much evidence a row rests on), features `boruta` (21 offence /
   17 defence, on-court columns in).  **Out-of-player**: five player folds balanced on the label, every
   player's prior from the fit that never saw his rows.  **The DEFENSIVE label is un-shrunk and the
   offensive one is not** (`--unshrink_label=def`, the default, adopted 2026-09-18).
3. **Rating**: `priorridge.PriorRidgeCV`, `scale x prior + residual`, the scale priced on cross-fitted
   prior columns (`--crossfit=scale`), the residual penalty fixed at **13,037** on both sides.  Then centred.

`outputs/season_ratings_product.parquet` (every other season allowed in the prior) is what
`docs/data/ratings.json` and the site are built from; it was rebuilt on 2026-09-18 and `poss_def` is a real
column now.  `outputs/season_ratings_unshrinkdef.parquet` is the same settings at
`--exclude_neighbours=1` and is **the incumbent every candidate is scored against**.
`artifacts/season_ratings.parquet` is the older system, kept for the tests; do not overwrite it.

Threads: the script pins BLAS to one thread and numba to four before importing anything.  **Never run two
builds at once**, and kill a chain's python children when you stop it.

## The test: year-over-year

Rate a season from its own games.  Predict every stint of the season before and after from the ten players'
ratings alone, refitting only the intercept and home edge on the scored season.  28 scored seasons, each
predicted twice, 56 observations.  The prior must not have seen the two scored seasons:

    .venv/Scripts/python scripts/62_single_year_board.py --exclude_neighbours=1 --score=0 --boards=<ten seasons> --out=season_ratings_<name>_<first>
        (three chunks of ten seasons, stitched; ~3 min a season, so ~95 min for thirty)
    .venv/Scripts/python scripts/63_yoy.py --rankings=<name>=outputs/season_ratings_<name>.parquet,incumbent=outputs/season_ratings_unshrinkdef.parquet --ref=incumbent --tag=<name> --splits=
    .venv/Scripts/python scripts/64_consensus_report.py outputs/season_ratings_<name>.parquet outputs/season_ratings_unshrinkdef.parquet
    .venv/Scripts/python scripts/66_compare.py incumbent=outputs/season_ratings_unshrinkdef.parquet <name>=outputs/season_ratings_<name>.parquet --season=2026 --top=20 --yoy=outputs/yoy_<name>.parquet --ref=incumbent

**Decision rule:** adopt only if `z` is -2 or below with no gross consensus miss and the 2026 top 20 not
worse; ties go to the simpler version.  Read the row "each side rescaled to the scored season" to see
whether the ORDER improved or only the spread.  `scale_*` below 1 on a neighbouring season is expected
(players change year to year) and is not a target.

**Saved priors**: `--save_priors=<name>` then `--priors_from=<name>` reruns the ridge alone in a second a
season, which is how the penalty was swept.

## The second criterion: the trade loss (new, 2026-09-18)

The year-over-year test is an error per team-game, so a 200-possession man is a rounding error in it.  The
trade loss counts every player once.  **It has already overturned one reading and confirmed six others.**

    .venv/Scripts/python scripts/70_tradeset.py --rankings=outputs/season_ratings_<name>.parquet --team_effects=team --out=tradeset_<name>   (85 s)
    .venv/Scripts/python scripts/73_tradeloss.py --alphas=incumbent=outputs/tradeset_team_alpha.parquet,<name>=outputs/tradeset_<name>_alpha.parquet --ref=incumbent

Paired by season on the exact intersection of eligible players; `--tier=` splits by exposure.  Read
`mean_diff` below zero as better and `z` against its own standard error.  It detects a defensive change of
0.0024 at z -2.2, so it has power at the size that matters.

## The record so far (year-over-year error per team-game, points per 100)

| rankings | error | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| shipped before this branch (`artifacts/`) | 8.587 | uses the banned `past_*` channel on offence |
| career row only, one per player | 8.804 | the starting point |
| + 1-3 season chunks (owner's design) | 8.736 | adopted |
| + scale cross-fitted, penalty not | 8.693 | adopted |
| + out-of-player priors | 8.705 | worse on the test, adopted by ruling 2 |
| + fixed penalty 13,037 | 8.697 | tie on the test; **the trade loss later read it z -2.19 on defence** |
| + the DEFENSIVE label un-shrunk (**the incumbent**) | **8.682** | z -5.24, 43 of 56; trade loss defence z -7.14, 27 of 30; adopted 2026-09-18 |
| rejected | | every chunk size; booster settings; off-court features; one row per player-season; cross-fitting the penalty; the un-shrunk label on BOTH sides (the 2026 offensive spread collapses 1.60 to 1.14, Curry falls to 61st); `onc_d` off the defensive list (the trade loss finds nothing) |

## THE FINDING to carry forward: OpenRAPM is about a sixth too wide, and three sources agree

Full numbers in `DECISIONS.md`, "The amplitude finding".

| source | offence | defence | what it measures |
|---|---|---|---|
| the consensus, GLS scale | x0.85 | x0.85 | the same season, against public metrics |
| the trade set, three-season window | x0.749 | x0.919 | adjacent seasons' team-games |
| the year-over-year sweep, interior optimum | x0.65 | x0.85 | the neighbouring seasons' games |

**One sign, three independent readings.**  There is no offence/defence imbalance -- an earlier claim of one
was an artefact of the consensus being scaled to EPM, withdrawn the same day.

**A rescale is still not adoptable** (experiment 20): the two across-season sources cannot separate "too
wide" from "players regress", and a uniform rescale reorders nobody -- the order-only row is zero to 4e-14.
So this wants fixing INSIDE the fit, not bolted on afterwards.

**The lead that goes with it: the high-usage creators.**  Six of the eight highest-usage players sit below
their consensus offence after the spreads are matched -- LaMelo Ball -1.70, Ja Morant -1.61, Luka -1.59,
Jokic -1.50, Booker -1.06, Giannis -0.83 -- while the correlation with usage over all 391 players is
**-0.00**, so it is the extreme top and not a gradient.  The trade set independently found **shot creation,
three-point rate and offensive rebound share are under-credited by the box prior**, and shot creation is
what this group is.  Not the explanation, measured and dismissed: age, experience, team quality; the whole
per-36 box profile explains 21% of the player-by-player gap.

**Also named and unexploited: on defence the prior reads team offence as defensive credit** -- a player
whose team scored while he was on the floor has his defensive correction pushed down 0.062.

## What is closed.  Do not reopen without a new reason.

- **The exposure correction** (the prior is flat in exposure, the truth is steep).  Six attempts, none beat
  the incumbent; the owner: *"whatever our version is as last posted seems to be good enough."*
- **The trade set as a product.**  Alpha reads neighbouring seasons, so it can never be published under
  ruling 1, and a season's statistics see 3.7% of it on offence and 5.6% on defence.  It is an instrument.
- **`onc_d` off the defensive feature list** (experiment 19): the trade loss finds nothing (z -0.40) where
  it detects the penalty change at z -2.19, and agreement fell against every public defensive metric,
  furthest against the luck-adjusted ones, so it was not the `def3` pattern that excuses a drop.  Ruled:
  keep `onc_d`.  Note the 2026 top 20 was NOT the reason -- to the eye it was arguably better.
- **The amplitude as a rescale** (experiment 20).  See above.
- **The team-movement weight as it stands.**  `singleyear.team_movement` is the Gini-Simpson index now
  (`1 - sum(share ** 2)`, the chance two possessions of a career came from different teams) with seven
  tests, but `--trade_weight` is off by default and at floor 0 it deletes the one-team players -- 29% of
  them, every single-franchise star -- which is what its one run lost on.  Sweep the floor if it is revived.

## The instruments, all read-only

| script | what it answers |
|---|---|
| `63_yoy.py` | the criterion: team-game error, both directions, paired by season |
| `70_tradeset.py` + `73_tradeloss.py` | the per-player loss that counts a bench player once |
| `74_consensus_bars.py` | how far OpenRAPM sits from the consensus in units of its own uncertainty, each side scaled |
| `75_amplitude.py` | a per-side multiplier sweep on a finished table |
| `76_bias_groups.py` | the published page: bias by player type, `vs consensus` and `vs 2026 observed` |
| `64_consensus_report.py` | rank agreement and spreads for several tables side by side |

`outputs/bgmm_proba.parquet` carries `player_id`, `season`, the winning player type and **all eight mixture
probabilities** for 2026, from a mixture fitted on 2023-2025 (one row per player-season) and used to place
2026 out of sample, standardised by the training seasons' own constants.  **The owner wants those eight
columns available to the prior code; that work has not started.**

Whether the two deltas on that page are related was the test the owner set for building position-level
categories: across the eight types, `vs consensus` against `vs 2026 observed` is **r -0.04** (the
2026-fitted types read +0.03).  No relationship, so position categories are not warranted by it.

## The site

`docs/index.html` (rankings, newest season first) and `docs/bias.html` (bias by player type).  Rebuild with
`scripts/52_site.py` then `scripts/76_bias_groups.py`, commit, and fast-forward `main` to publish.  The bias
page is deliberately a title, one table and two short paragraphs; the owner has trimmed it twice.

## Traps that cost a day

1. **The consensus file was rescaled twice on 2026-09-18** -- once to make it a real consensus rather than
   one dominated by collinear raw-points metrics, once to turn off the scaling to EPM.  **No consensus
   spread or agreement figure is comparable across those changes.**  Both rescales moved `adj_*` for ~550 of
   582 players at correlation 0.99+, so a number can look like the same measurement and not be.
2. **`defense` in the rankings parquet is points allowed, negative-good.  `rating_def` is the positive-good
   column**, and `rating_total = rating_off + rating_def`.  Adding `offense + defense` gives a
   plausible-looking table with the defensive sign inverted.
3. **An uncentred table cannot be differenced against a centred one** without removing the level first.
   Anything built before 2026-09-14 predates the centring rule; 4b sits at +1.61 on offence in 2026.
4. **Stint level and team-game level disagree in this project**, and have given opposite signs on
   amplitude.  Say which one a number is.
5. `pip install -e` puts this working tree on `sys.path`: a fresh clone silently tests THIS repo's data.
6. Tests cannot reach the network (`tests/conftest.py`).
7. A score on a mask that cuts team-games is not a score; read stint-cutting splits on `mse`.
8. Two builds at once, or an unpinned numba pool, and a 15-second fit takes an hour.
9. `TaskStop` on a chain stops the bash wrapper only; its python children keep running.  Check
   `Get-Process python` before starting anything.
10. Seventeen more in `DECISIONS.md`, "The measurement traps".

## The one failing test, accepted by the owner (2026-09-18)

`tests/test_vs_consensus.py::test_star_guards_are_not_buried` puts LaMelo Ball at rank 162 against a
hand-set ceiling of 160 on the rebuilt published table.  **In points that is 0.016 per 100** -- he sits
0.168, the player at rank 160 sits 0.184 -- six times smaller than the owner's threshold for nothing, and
the check is a rank ceiling, the instrument the owner has ruled does not measure size.  The owner: *"that
test can fail, no worries."*  The honest fix, not done, is to replace the rank ceiling with a points check.

## Where to start next

1. **Credit shot creation properly in the prior.**  The one live lead with two independent measurements
   behind it (the creator gap above, and the trade set's under-credited statistics).  A feature change,
   then the test and the trade loss like anything else.  One build.
2. **Split on-court plus-minus into its offensive and defensive halves** so the defensive fit cannot read
   team scoring as defensive credit.  Named mechanism, one build.
3. **The eight mixture probability columns into the prior**, which the owner has asked for.  The input is
   written; nothing is wired.
4. **A standard error per player for alpha**, from the inverse of the trade set's own matrix, so a
   correction can be read against its own noise.  Half a day.
